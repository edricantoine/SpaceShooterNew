# SpaceShooters

# Currently (probably) only works on Mac!

A retro-inspired 2D shoot-'em-up game. Repo had to be remade after the old one caught fire, and Xcode decided to be a pain. Because I only own one development machine, it's a bit hard for me to check if it, you know, actually works on other machines.

This application is a simple 2D shoot-'em-up game (think Space Invaders), which I decided to create as a way to get some practice with the C++ language as well as learn the basics of game development using the SDL2 graphics framework. I think the gameplay is simple enough to understand, and doesn't really require much explaining.

I hope you enjoy!

To run this project:

**PLEASE INSTALL THE SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_mixer, and SDL2_image frameworks. MAKE SURE THEY ARE IN YOUR /Library/Frameworks FOLDER. THIS IS A TEMPORARY (!) WORKAROUND UNTIL I FIX ISSUES WITH EMBEDDING THESE FRAMEWORKS WITHIN THE APP.**

Use the executable file "SpaceShooters" in the outermost folder. DO NOT CHANGE FOLDER STRUCTURE OR THE GAME WON'T WORK!

NOTE: THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS.

To add in the future:
Enemies:

Boss: Takes many hits, complex attack pattern
Misc:

Boss and title screen music
SFX
Add explosion death animation for enemies
Pause menu, with option to return to the title screen

Thanks for taking the time to look at this project!
